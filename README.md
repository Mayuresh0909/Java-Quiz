# Java-Quiz

This project tests students understanding about Java Programming language using 3 level testing. 
Each level consists of 5 questions to be answered. 
 
Level 1: (EASY DIFFICULTY LEVEL)  
If a student Is able to able answer at least four correct questions out of five that means student has basic knowledge about Java programming language and he is able to understand Java. The score is shown up and the student is promoted to next level. 
 
Level 2: (MEDIUM DIFFICULTY LEVEL)  
If a student answers at least 3 questions correctly out of 5 questions given, this shows that student is having enough knowledge about Java programming language and he is able to perform well Java. The score out of 5 is shown up and the student is promoted to next level. 
 
Level 3: (EXPERT DIFFICULTY LEVEL)  
This level consists of some tough questioning with questions mostly testing student’s ability to guess the output of given program. If the student answers at least two questions correctly out of 5, this shows that the student has very good knowledge about java programming language. The score card and the message quoting “Congratulations you are a Java Expert is printed on the screen”. 
 
The following concepts of Java programming have been extensively used in our project: 
1. Objects 
 
2. Classes 
 
3. Inheritance 
 
4. Importing crucial libraries for better User Experience 
 
5. Advanced Java Functions (eg. charAt()) have been used to explore the language more evidently 

If – Else conditioning has been used for marking and grading the user. When a question is displayed on the screen, the user has to enter the variable corresponding to the option which indicates the choice the user has to give. This format is not only easy to use, but also easy to maintain.  
 
It is easy to maintain because of the following reasons: 1. If a user enters some other choice, it is possible to either specify his mistake and ask him to rectify it; or straightaway disqualify from attempting the quiz.  
 
2. This can be done by typing required and relevant code in the ‘else’ parenthesis of the source code. 

3. Suppose after 1000 runs or so, the questions become repetitive and stale. It is required that the programmer must change the questions to maintain the uniqueness, original and state – of – the – art USPs (Unique Selling Points) of the program.  
 
4. This is also possible very easily as the questions are written directly into the program and not into some file or database (which is, in reality, very difficult to maintain).  
 
5. As one can see, given the length and duration of the program, the code written is not so big! This is HUGE advantage over other quiz programs which have thousands of lines of code written in them! And even then, they do not work properly as expected from a thousand code program.  
 
6. Our program is not more than 300 lines. This means it can be loaded into the memory very easily and very quickly, too! Therefore, Time Complexity of our program is very low.  
 
7. Parallelly, since the program is less than 300 lines long, it takes very less space to be stored! (300 lines is around 3-4 Kilobytes). This means Space Complexity of our program is also very low! 
 
8. Thus, our project scores well in the famous ‘Time – Space Complexity’, a parameter used for quality testing of even the greatest and largest programs and softwares in the industry.
